# **Machine Learning in Professional Sports Gambling**
## **AccuScore** - *AI for the win*

[AccuScore](https://accuscore.com/) is a global leader in sports forecasting using machine learning to accurately simulate the outcome of sporting events.

To date, Accuscore has received undisclosed rounds of venture funding from venture capital firms, angel investors, and strategic partnerships over the years.  They were acquired by QL gaming as part of $1.1 million funding round in May of 2020 to strengthen QL Gamings primary platform BetQL and provide their customers a betting edge. [^2]:

## Sports Betting Prediction Landscape and Results
As of 2020, the global sports betting market was approximately $203 billion [^5]: and the Fantasy sports market is an additional $31.73 billion and growing. [^6]: Accuscore is one of the leading providers of predictive modeling in the space and poised to continue to thrive from the ever growing market. 
>"The global online gambling market size was valued at USD 53.7 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% from 2020 to 2027." - Grand View Research

The rise in availability of online gambling has made the predictive analysis market a lucrative and crowded space.  There are many competitors in the industry and some notible ones are FifeThirtyEight, Numberfire, SportsLine, and Betegy. Accuscore has been using AI technology and human innovation to become one of the premiere leaders in providing a better's edge.  AI has been able to provide further data anlysis, help mitigate risk, and provide predicitve modeling to their bettor's to increase engagement and draw in new customers with the technology.

Accuscore has provided such good results that they were acquired by BetQL and now offered as part of the service subscription model on BetQL's platform.  Their predictions have been so accurate that betting $100 on every game would have produced the following:
 - NBA - $27,000 on point spread totals and home/away wins from the 2016-2016 season start
 - NFL - $9,000 a year profit betting point spread from 2009 on 
 - Soccer - $80,000 bankroll picking winners from 2014 on
These kinds of profits are what have made Accuscore a leader in the field and a trusted name for sports fans worldwide.

## AI for the AI generation
My reccomendation for the furture of Accuscore would be to have an increased focus on the eSports arena.  eSports betting has become a multi-billion dollar a year industry and is ready for massive growth in the coming years.  With a market looking to reach $6.82 billion by 2027 and an active fan/audience size nearing 500 million worldwide, this is a huge space to invest in.

Why eSports betting?  Furthering the AI capabilities in this part of the business makes sense due to the audience involved and the availability of a large amount of historical and real-time data. The core audience of eSports is a young, tech-savy, engaged audience who would surely see the appeal of using a service with the most advanced AI for eSports. With the top gaming companies having a huge amount of data available through API data integrations the machine learning and data alaysis Accuscore already utilizes could be further automated to better predict outcomes of the events in this space.  

The fact that Accuscore/BetQL has already grown on being leaders in some of the lesser watched sports gives it a further advantage to grow quickly in the eSports space.  Diving deeper into eSports could also be appealing to those already using the services for those smaller market sports.  With an ever growing audience of young people in the eSports space and an already established customer base looking to bet on non-traditional sports; increasing AI capabilities for eSports seems like a winning bet for Accuscore.
